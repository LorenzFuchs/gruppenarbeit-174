        <h2>How does Add Task work</h2>
        <p>Join is a Kanban management program with which tasks are added in the Add Task section. These tasks get certain parameters such as title and description. They are also assigned to a category that determines their urgency.</p>

        <h2>How does Backlog work</h2>
        <p>In Backlog, the task created in Addtask is displayed. Here you can edit, delete and activate any task. An activated task is moved to the Board.</p>


        <h2>How does Board work</h2>
        <p>In Board, the tasks from the Backlog are displayed in their processing status. This includes the first status "To Do" and the last status "Done". You can move the tasks to another status using drag&drop, edit, delete.</p>
